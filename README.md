# hello-world
my first hello world thingy
I am here to learn new things! I love new things. I've been interested in coding for quite some time. I've always wanted to create programs that help people learn things that I've struggled to learn in the past (i.e., music theory, and the art of proper blowgun maintenance). This is going to be a great first step for me. The second step is of course, world domination, baby.
